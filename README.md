This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
- Next JS by default pre-renders all pages that have static content 
- Next JS pre-renders a page and then hydrates it with React code to have a functional react app, at the end
- getStaticProps can only be added to pages file, under page folder and the content written in that function is never send to the client.
- We can write both server and client code in that function, but some client restrictions are there, like no access to global or window object.
- getStaticProps - also indicates to Next that pre-render a page, if present.
- getStaticProps should always return an Object that has a props key.
- Next JS will fist execute this getStaticProps function and then pass the result to the Component as props in the next step, when it executes the Component code.
- Next JS has a incremental static generation, which will regenerated for every request, and we can pass in a time interval.for re-generating a new page at most every X seconds.
- we can do that by adding a new attribute "revalidate" in the return of the getStaticProps, along with the props.The value for it is in seconds.
- During dev server the page will be always regenerated.
- getStaticProps receives an argument called 'context' which is an object.
- dynamic pages will not be pre-generated by default
- dynamic pages are generated just in time
- getStaticPaths function is only added to dynamic generated files.
- Next Js also provides a way to run server code on every request.
- That code is added to getServerSideProps and can only added to Page Component file.
- Should only use either the getServerSideProps or  the getStaticProps.
-  getServerSideProps also returns an Object that has same structure as getStaticProps, except we cannot add revalidate key.
- context in getServerSideProps, gets access to full request and response besides the params
